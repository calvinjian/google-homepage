Hi,

this is a project I'm doing as  part of TOP Web_101 Course. I'm supposed to recreate Google's homepage. Here's the link to the project: From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).

I will edit this file when I finish the project and explain what I did and how I did it. Thanks!
